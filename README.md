*Note: The image was taken with a phone due to technical issues with my laptop's screenshot function, so the resolution may not be ideal.*
###Next Steps:

-there are still missing pages 
-final design isnt approved , still needs more styling 
-only one functional feature were added to the project

we will continue updating the progress as we move forward.

*Note: The image above shows the current interface at this stage of development. The project is still in the early stages, and many features are yet to be implemented.*
